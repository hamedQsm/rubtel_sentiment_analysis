My brother mentioned Rebtel and at a chance I sign up 3months ago but dont use it frequently but then this month I was looking at account and realised I still have some money left which prompted to compute the cost per minute boy what a surprise. Rebtel was way cheaper than what I was using imagine my lost minutes for the last five years oh well am with Rebtel now.","star-rating count-5 size-medium clearfix"

"84","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=84","Mainly great service, but some sneaky charges turned me off","I was excited by Rebtel when it was first recommended to me by a friend, and I've used it several times with success. However, in a recent experience, I called someone, they didn't answer, but then they called back using the Rebtel numbers, and unknowingly I somehow ""accepted"" a collect call. Because I believed the rate to be 1.5 cents per minute, I talked for 30 minutes, only to find my account charged for close to $9. Apparently a small noise made at the beginning of my call was supposed to alert me that I was getting charged at this absurdly high rate. I think it's abusive of Rebtel to believe anyone could figure that out. I promptly went into my settings and changed my alert for receiving collect calls - I suggest all other users do the same. But I am now much more hesitant to use Rebtel due to fear of other hidden charges.","star-rating count-3 size-medium clearfix"

"","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=43","Excellent until...","I talk to overseas people, mostly in Africa, for almost 2,000 minutes a month. I used 'phone cards until I realised their published rates only applied for the first 4 minutes of each call--then rates sky-rocket! It is very sneaky, this detail is in the small print. You may think you are paying, say, 9p/minute but you are likely to be paying 20-30p/minute.

So I was delighted to find Rebtel, which did not engage in this underhand practice. With no card number to enter, Rebtel was easier to use and the ability to allocate a UK number to frequently called overseas numbers was brilliant. With Rebtel calling abroad whilst driving became easy.

After a few months of being very happy with Rebtel (call quality is generally better than calling cards too), I noticed the cost of calls to Zambia had suddenly tripled! No notification, nothing. Needless to say, I no longer use Rebtel.

Rebtel is a very good service but check the rates charged and keep checking--don't get caught out as I did.","star-rating count-3 size-medium clearfix"

1 Star considering as BAD .. But the REBTEL service is even worst.

I took the rebtel subscription on Last week of January, And they clearly mentioned about the pricing information for monthly subscription.
Refer the rebtel website 

So I recharged with that amount, Just after 4 to 5 days got a voice mail saying that make another recharge with the same amount to make a call.

I proceed recharge with that amount again though its not a month and send an email I got an acknowledgement but didn't response yet.

And very unfortunate thing is they didn't even have a customer support number to make a call and the only way is you should wait and keep on recharge with that amount until they'll respond.

We never know when they'll respond, Because there is no dead line date for that.

This is the response I got from REBTEL two days before :

I had used it Rebtel for at least 3 years now, successfully only to wake up to the worst case scenario and an even worse customer service platform. They posted on their Facebook page that they couldn't connect calls. Of course I haven't even opened my own Facebook profile in years, how would I know, so I make calls unknowingly that Rebtel is not working. Mind you, voice system says everything it says on any other normal day, ""Welcome to Rebel please enter the international number you want to call'"" etc. So I call, I have topped up my account with about 500 minutes so I'm not even worried. I make my usual calls, to all my relatives, friends unknowingly. The next day I find out that instead of charging my Rebtel account as was supposed to happen all the calls (now I know it was due to their connectivity issues) of course AT&T picked them all up and now I had a $400 bill. After five days of trying to contact them, I wind up having to contact them through Facebook, and they end up saying oh we don't see any of your calls on our logs, well of course if your system was actually down you aren't going to see anything. Then they say we'll give you $20 credit as a sign of good faith. $400, $20 , good faith? Come on now. And then they try hide behind the issue of not interfering with third parties, no this is about how your system fooled me. At this point it's not even about just the bill, the emotional toll all this has taken on me is included.

The paying methods are diverse, but my only complain is that when you pay with one account (ex. Skrill) it stays saved an you can't use another skrill.account.
The rates are really the best ones in the market!","star-rating count-4 size-medium clearfix"

If I can't do what I seamlessly did before, then it's probably time to move on. I'm sure someone else does it better.

I will be the first to say Rebtel's call quality  bar-none is one of the best in the business but if I can't add a new number to my account, I don't see the point in keeping my account. I'm sure having multiple number comes at a cost, but what about recycling old numbers? 

I hope someone reads this and fixes this problem before it's too late, I can see other reviewer complaining as well. And telling me to send a private message on facebook will not cut it. you should be aware of this problem by now, and you guys are not, then more power to you.

The only reason I signed up for your service was for the ease of use.

"","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=83","wow!","It's so nice to get a number in Amsterdam for each person I want to call abroad. I can use my landline for that with unlimited calls to landlines in the Netherlands. I can also use my mobile with 800 minutes for landllines and mobile lines in the Netherlands for that. I don't have to be online after I have purchased credit for my Rebtel account. The fees for several countries are great. India is cheaper than ever. I used to have €0,015 as the smallest fee and several times I paid €0,02 to €0,03/minute. Now only €0,008 and only when the line is answered. Ghana and Mali have competetive prices. They can't still be cheap as €0,07 would be. But they are just below €0,15 and that's quite a standard price for other cheap ways of calling those countries. Rebtel has managed to keep their prices a little below that price of €0,15 which I consider a great accomplishment.
Uganda and Kenya and even Pakistan are relatively cheap at €0,07 app. Very happy about that.

Sending an sms must be done on the website. However you can type fast as you can use a normal keyboard which isn't possible on a handy. Sms's are cheap. I would have to pay €0,55 for sending an sms to India with my mobile phone provider. Now with Rebtel it costs €0,02. I also get to see when the sms is delivered. Great! I can see exactly how long it took for the sms to be delivered. I can also allow the other person to call me back or sms me back at my cost. Best of all: I don't have to pay incase the other person doesn't answer the phone. Incase I would use a cheap service number (0900 numbers) in the Netherlands for which I can call India for €0,02 I would still have to pay for the 1 minute and 25 seconds I was trying to reach him. That is rounded to 2 minutes so it would cost me €0,04 in total. If I would do that multiples times (as I have done at times) I am still spending a lot of money.

On the downside: I can't let somebody call me back or sms me back for free incase they don't have a working internet connection on their mobile phone. They might not have a subscription for internet or their bundle might have finished or they might not have purchased internet as they might not have enough money for that. In all of these cases they can't just simply call me back at my cost. That's different with a Collect Call. An operator will ask permission and will connect the other person to me at my cost. It is expensive of course but it works. Now however people can only respond incase they can access the internet. It would have been nice if the system recognizes that I have used Rebtel for sending the sms or for calling them so that the system automatically will deduct the collect call fees for a call or sms of my Rebtel account.

Keep going!","star-rating count-5 size-medium clearfix"

We wanted a full refund of $90 balance due to continuing poor quality of service. E-mailed them at the proper address. No answer. E-mailed again weeks later- no answer. Could find no phone number whatsoever at which to call them. Expect much better of Swedish company.

Have revised up from two to three stars due to company efforts to rectify (their reply here) and my having found their place on-line where one can cancel service. Still, reply to emails is expectable.

First, my subscription got canceled for whatever reason. I emailed them about the matter and it's been weeks now and they haven't replied and said nothing! And since I really needed to call internationally and didn't have time to find another app I could use to make international calls, I had to buy the World credit wich only gave me 60 minutes for $10. But that didn't work out so well either  because when I would place a call, it redirected to other people's number where each time I would make a call it would go to different country, and I now this because they would speak a different language each time I made a call. So, I am very disappointed.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

I call a lot and in fact use 600 minutes to call Nigeria  in less than a week but its so worth it because the call quality is super good, there are few glitches sometimes though but for an international call its not too bad. Also the call connects even if the other party's phone is switched off this is very bad And am taking a star out for that. It made me think my fiancée was quarrelling with me and won't pick up her phone whereas her phone was completely off because she couldn't charge he phone. Also my credit got deducted for those dials about 20min plus because I continued dialing and each dial lasted 2 mins each which really made me mad. well am over it now.

Beware!!!","I was a loyal Rebtel customer for the past few years (about 4 years) and Rebtel has been a better choice for me. I even wrote an excellent review in the past concerning quality and great customer service compared to other services. The price has been an issue from the beginning until the recent outrageous hike made me update my review. Calling Ethiopia went from average 19 cents(US) up to 27 cents per minute. That is a difference of 8 cents per minute!! I was using a deal that allowed me to talk for 50 minutes with approximately $10. Now, $10 allows you to talk only for 34 minutes and that is 27 cents per minute. I have been sticking around after their price changes in the past ( partly due to the ""deals"") and the problem I had with my mobile carrier third party application issue but this time, I am leaving for good! A price hike like this is not acceptable and I will be posting this on social media so that other Ethiopians stop using this service. I know many people who are doing that already, thanks to free internet calls and more internet coverage to Ethiopia. Why should we pay this much in 2016? Bye Rebtel! I am cancelling my account as we speak. I will start by taking away my credit card information from my profile and try other services for this week.

"68","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=68","They cheat with charges and sometimes call quality is unacceptable","The worst issue is that some numbers (not all) they allocate are listed as LOCAL NUMBERS but when you dial them then on the next bill from your phone provider you find that they were NOT local numbers and you have to pay TWICE for the same call: normal rates to your provider and Rebtel rates to Rebtel. So much about ""special low rates"".

And they charge in $US or Euro. You CAN NOT select $AUD, which means every time you re charge you pay via 'bad' exchange rate (I checked this) and on top of that you might be charged 'international processing fee' (which is my case was approx $1 for every $10 purchased). 

Sometimes call quality is so bad that I just had to hang up and try again the next day.

I strongly NOT recommend Rebtel - try some other ones - when my credit is used up I will switch to another one.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

This is a real problem and questionable technique… dare I say ""scam."" 

I'm already paying a local rate every time a call is initiated without connection using a local number during this erroneous ringing period — why should we also pay an international FOR NO CONNECTION?

Few months back one of my son's colleagues suggested Rebtel to make cheap international calls. My son explained to me the concept of Rebtel which is based on internet telephony and why the calls made using Rebtel are cheap. Both of us have local Rebtel numbers on which we make a call, which gets internationally connected and that's how we speak to each other, every third day. And it is super easy to use. I don't have to worry about the bill s I can make payment through my credit card.

I would sincerely recommend their customer support for guiding me through the entire process. Since my son is always busy on field, I take help from Rebtel customer support. The support system is apt and easily understandable by someone like me who is not technology friendly. I have even suggested Rebtel to my sister living in downtown Chicago.

I just have one suggestion, please post me newsletters or other offers since I don't use the internet often.

After making my first phone calls I received my bill from my mobile phone Provider (Orange) and had to pay € 17 extra for just 4 calls.
Although the calls were transfered through a local number in Madrid I had to pay double for using Rebtel. After informing the helpdesk of Rebtel twice  I did not get any answer. Rebtel  seems to be a clear cheat  to me.

Hans van Maanen

After 3 times sending an e-mail to Rebtel help desk I am still waiting for a proper answer on my questions !!

This the 4th reaction of Rebtel in which they do not answer the questuion.

But still I was charged !!! twice by ORANGE € includid IVA almost € 17 for 5 calls and by Repted the normal charge.

I have uninstalled the Rebtel App from my android phone as I consider that neither Rebtel nor google nor anyone else needs to have access to my private contact list nor any other private data.

"54","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=54","Too bad...","A few years ago I connected with Rebtel for the first time - and at first the service, prices and prompt replies to my questions made a lasting good impression: I needed an cross platform app that enabled cheap international calls using smart-phone and PC.
For that reason I established a balance, intended principally to enable international calls from my PC.

Very suddenly the PC call app was discontinued unilaterally by Rebtel. I inquired as soon as I found out (in 2013 in believe) and I was informed that reinstating a pc app ""is in the road-map"".

Now we are in 2015 - and it seems that the ""Road-map"" is lost, and I requested reimbursement of my Rebtel balance and to my admonishment received a negative reply!
The excuse was that PayPal does not allow a refund after more than 90 days! 
All I know is that paid Rebtel case for a specific service, the service I paid for was terminated ‘till an as yet unspecified date, and Rebtel refuse to reimburse me? 
The excuse that Paypal do not allow refund after more than 90 days is a lame excuse because PayPal certainly allows issuing a new payment - in this case from Rebtel to me for the unused balance of the account.

It gives great quality during calls, sms possibility. The company also gives a local phone number I could call which redirects my calls (after authentication) to that direction I set up before. Not to mention Rebtel prizes are really cheap for some direction what I use on regular basis. 

I could imagine cheaper prizes for some direction (e.g.: Hungary), adding friend to contact list on PC seems not always works perfectly, missing video call option in case you want to use PC-PC call, no possibility to follow up my balance during the call (calling from PC application), what could be really annoying in case I would be close to my limit.

Rebtel website also should make some reorganisation on main page, before joining it was really hard to find calling rates, but that should be on focus every time to find it easy. It is really positive they show how many minutes you could get by $10, but would be great to see even my available balance how much minutes worth to different directions.

All in one: I recommend them, I'm happy to be their customer but would be happy to see some  more improvement from Rebtel.","star-rating count-4 size-medium clearfix"

Calls which should have cost me €23,80 have now been charged to me for the amount of €361,10. My provider have rejected my request for investigation that the calls were made via a REBTEL contact number as on the REBTEL  site. I have subsequently mailed Rebtel and am waiting for an answer.   I cannot believe this has happened and have requested they pay my provider (refund me) for the costs incurred.  Just getting my money back that I have paid via credit card to REBTEL is not an option as the purchase was made in good faith so that I could call cheaply to South Africa.   I hope there is a procedure for REBTEL  to take their full responsibility for this problem as they have reputable reviews which I checked at length before signing up for their service.  I advise that REBTEL remove deals from their website to avoid other people becoming victims of the same fate as it is for a reason we use REBTEL. NOT to be charged by our providers. January I used REBTEL via a contact number in Brussels to contact South Africa and my provider did not charge me.  February they charged me for every call made.  I sent 2 mails to REBTEL support last night with  proof of my bill from my provider clearly stating the number I called was the number given on the site as a the contact number for the country I was calling which was +27 87 550 23 47;  and will have to wait the 48 hours it will take to get an answer. I hope REBTEL contact my provider to sort this out as there is nowhere I can find a telephone number for customer service as everything has to be done by mail.  I hope and trust REBTEL will  solve this as it a very unpleasant experience. I have always had good response from Patricia at customer service.  In the meantime do not make any calls using a REBTEL contact number in your destination country.  Your provider will charge you full price.  Now is the time for me and for all of us  to really rate REBTEL on their customer service and solving this problem.   It is when things go wrong that the reviews really count.  I will keep everyone posted on progress in this matter.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

I am in Ireland and have used Rebtel for a while. Recently they locked my account and when I try to log on it comes up with a ""restricted number"" message. The rebtel app on the phone says ""cannot connect to Rebtel server"". I contacted their customer services and they said its locked because of a number I called in Zimbabwe which is a normal mobile number for my uncle.  They said they would pass this case to their technical department and I never heard from them after that despite sending them a follow up email. 

They then send me 2 emails showing money they continue deducting from my bank account despite the fact that my account is locked and I cant change my preferences and/or close the account. If this is not outright fraud then I don't know what is. I am now having to go to the trouble of contacting my bank and ordering a new card. Its ok when you are using them but please don't use rebtel at all. I will now use telephone cards which I buy of shops.

Last month, I reached out to them asking why i was charged twice and they said, sorry, it was their system error and they cant refund, instead i can use their service for the amount they charged me. Which means I only wanted 30 days of service and they forced me 60 days service by charging twice. They also said, this won't repeat. I removed my credit card details and added a new credit card so that, they wont use my old credit card to charge twice again. Just found they have again charged me twice on the new credit card.

Received compensation after this review.","Update: after back-and-forth messages with the customer service - I should point out that they assigned a different agent per email - I have received a compensation. Mind you, this only came about after days of having to explain and pressurizing their customer service agents.

When you order a $10 meal off of a menu in a restaurant, how much do you expect to pay for it when you ask for the bill? In normal state of affairs,  you'd pay the price listed in the menu. But the same logic does not apply to Rebtel's service, which I found out through a first-hand experience. 

I come from Uzbekistan, and was pleased to learn that I could stay in touch with my family as Rebtel seemingly offered a very attractive rate to call numbers in the country: 0.023 EUR per minute. However, after a few calls it came to my attention that I was running out of credit way too quickly. Upon reviewing my activity log, I was disturbed to learn that the company had charged me between 0.23 to 1.34 EUR per minute on different calls to the exact same numbers. That is 10 and 58 times the rate which is indicated on the app - 0.023 EUR/min - which also conveniently shows up before I made the each call.  

I quote from the customer service response to my inquiry regarding this matter: ""I can assure you that we wanted to keep the same rates, but we were forced to increase them due to capacity issues and to be able to sustain the same level of quality.""

Going back to the restaurant comparison: in a similar scenario to the one I am experiencing with Rebtel, you'd be paying anywhere between $100 to $580 for the $10 meal you had ordered. And you would find that out only after you had eaten the damn food. The server would kindly inform you that ""due to capacity issues"" the meal you just ate got much more expensive now - so deal with it. 

No restaurant would be allowed to continue conducting business in this fraudulent manner, and neither should any company. Avoid this service if you do not feel like dealing with multiple customer service agents just to get your money back.","star-rating count-2 size-medium clearfix"

2. Masked destination ringing. When dialing a number, you do not hear destination ringing, you hear some rebtel ring until  the other end picks up the phone. That means you do not know if the phone is closed, or rang. I am interested to have normal phone call where i hear whatever i hear when calling from normal phone.
3. clunky application. No easy way to use access numbers.
4. now no sms.
5. a dialer is not supposed to be a nuclear reactor. Dialer is a dialer. Something that you can type a number and press dial. With options to copy paste modify the number. I dont need your assistance on finding the country code, i know what i want to call, so you should remove this stupid list of countries. One you have an app that works, and no one is complaining, just stick with it. I do not understand why you feel obliged and urged to invent the weel every now and then.

On my recent call to Japan, I was able to hear my mother on the other end, but she did not hear me at all, so she hung up - 7 cents for this. Both of us could hear each other on the 2nd call. Then my phone lost battery, so the call was terminated, and I called again. Same as the 1st call - my mother did not hear me - another 7 cents for nothing. I called back and it worked okay for a while, but my balance was getting low, so I added funds ($10) during the call. Guess what? The call was ended by Rebtel when the balance dropped to $10.03. Yes, there were beeps and notifications, and also automated operator was asking me to add funds. I already added funds online, so I did not add more funds on the phone. I switched from Google Voice due to the fact I had to close my Google accout. Rebtel calls worked better at the same rate of 2 cents a minute as Google Voice, before the rate went up to 7 cents.

There is no customer service number, email is the only method of communication.  In both cases, I was locked out due to a specific number they claimed I called.  I was told that number was in a block of numbers that they claim have been perpetrators of fraud on their service.  I have never called the number they claimed I called.  Hopefully their automatic fraud detection system will improve, as it is obviously quite buggy.  I'm sure they could have handled this better as well.  Other than that, the price is right and I haven't noticed any issues with the call quality.

"","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=37","Go back to the rebtel version you guys had before please!","The new version of rebtel along with the customer people is awful now!!! What happened with you Rebtel!! I've been using your services for almost 6 years now and if you don't change I'm going to switch to another company. The main reason why I was with you guys was because you guys had the option to call somebody free by returning the call, now you are like any other company and even worst because your app is full of inconsistencies, bugs and it lacks of options, so it really doens't make any sense for me to keep using your services. 

Just in case you guys read this review the main things I can complain about is:

1st and the most annoying, there's no place anywhere in the website or app where to contact customer service, my wife has a problem connecting and it just says ""something went wrong (what? who knows!) Please try again later or contact us (where?) if the problem persists"".

2nd You guys are claiming that we can call for free to other people using the app without using wifi or internet but when I turn off wifi or mobile internet and I try to make a call to another person that has the app it says ""no internet connection to make this call"", so you are basically liars here.

3rd. I sent a complain about the problems that I'm experiencing to the old support email that I have from you guys (I'm lucky I could find it in my old emails) and I just got an email saying that you guys received the complaint and I will be contacted as soon as possible, but 5 days have passed and I haven't had any luck by getting a response ticket number (#821300) in case you are interested. 

4th. Your app is horrible now and your new look is horrible as well.

and a list of the other complains so far: 
Where can I find the free call phone for each of my contacts?
How can I know if the call I made or I received was a free call or a normal call?
How can I see in the list of calls if it was an incoming call or outgoing one?
I can't save my preferences after I click the button save, it says that my preferences were saved but I see the same options I had before. 
How can I change the number of a contact, it only let me change the name now?

I'm thinking in going with other company as soon as I run out of credits seriously if you guys don't go back to the previous version you guys had before. 
It seems like Rebtel has a new owner or whatever but the new owner just doesn't know how to run the business. I mean you guys had millions of users and I bet each day you will lose more and more if you don't change that ""new version"".","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

Managing and analyzing everything from my credits to calls I made is pretty good and easy. Being able to receive collect calls is pretty flexible. And the assigned 7 digits local numbers corresponding to my international numbers makes the process very pleasant and swift. To be able to use these facilities with multiple phone numbers is very nice as well...
And I certainly appreciate the quality of responds that arrives eventually :)
Although one would say that a potentially renowned telephone company should have  A Customer phone number available to desperately help seeking customers... Even though as terrifying as it sounds! 

I'm looking forward to get some complementary bonus rounds introducing your company...  Keep up the good work..

PS. I realize that my review sounds a bit promotional and I must apologize for that.. Hence your advice to be as friendly as possible but  this is what I could offer so that's what just I did... :)","star-rating count-5 size-medium clearfix"

I used to recommend it to my friends, but I will NEVER do that again. There are so many other options out there. It might cost you a bit more, but you can stay out of future trouble.

In my case, I could no longer to log in from my mobile app since they turned their logo upside down. It's been months. Thanks to Google, I was able to find out their well buried 'Report a Problem' button and send a few messages. At first, I received replies with staff's names listed in the end of the messages, though the replies are not for my issues, or just a product of 'copy and paste' in my opinion. As it went on, I could only receive automatic replies generated by system itself. As for now, I filled another web form days ago, no response, even from a machine, yet.

Their new logo is shiny, so is their new website. However, if you dare look for their contact information, you are assured of disappointment. Except for a 'Report a problem' button, you will find nothing else. If you are lucky enough, you will receive their machine-generated replies, or nothing at all.

You can smell it that the 'machine' is still running there, but the people who run it are absent. Imagine that. How cool it is to let the 'system' itself solve all problems for you.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

First you register (with your own telephone number from your country) for their service, buy a minimal credit of 5€ + EU tax, and then you enter an international number you wish to call, and Rebtel gives you an local number. When you call this local number that Rebtel gave you (you can only call it from your own number that you register with), Rebtel will connect you with an international number you wish to call.

Like I said, first you need to register (enter it to Rebtel system via web interface) your own number (from wich you will be calling) and also that international number that you wish to call.

Everything went well and everything was O.K. for first 100 minutes, which they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. Then Rebtel start to make this harassments and demands to tell them what is this number that I am calling (it was just one Estonian mobile number), to whom this number belongs, and why am I calling just and only this number (?!).

Also they suspended my account (I can not make calls anymore, although I still have valid balance, and I paid for this service upfront), telling me that it is for my own protection. I do not understand why, as I registered all numbers in their system, and I paid for this service, therefor, I should call whoever I want. But Rebtel thinks that I should explain to them why am I calling this number, and who is the owner of this Estonian mobile number that I was calling! Outrageous!

Also, I recomended several of my friends (because until now I was really satisfied with the quality of their service and price), and one of them got suspended also!

When they suspend you, you got an automatic e-mail telling you that you are suspended, and you can not login, or make new calls even if you have balance and you paid for this service upfront. You have to write them and ask why they suspended you and why you can not use this service that you paid for, then you have to wait for their answer, and then this harrassment started.

I believe that I did not done anything wrong, I registered and paid for this service, I was calling Estonian mobile number and they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. But, as I said, after 100 minutes they suspended my account and started to harassment me with these questions and asked me to provide them with some informations that was not their concern.

I paid for the service, they charged me, and therefore, I should call whoever I want, even this is one Estonian number, without explaining myself to anyone. I did not done anything wrong. But no, they suspended my account and they started to harassment me.

My friend has also the same problem. We selected Rebtel as they have the most affordable calling rates for Estonia, and they provided you with local number to call. So it was really affordable, and I would (and I did!) recommended Rebtel to anyone, but then this started.

So I writting this complaint to let everyone know what did Rebtel done and what can you expect from Rebtel.","star-rating count-2 size-medium clearfix"

I was told about Rebtel by my friend and I googled Rebtel Website. The welcome page says Unlimited Calls to India and Try One week free. I created an account on Nov 8th 2:25 PM hence I was eligible under free trial until Nov 15th. I decided to continue hence a payment of $10 was deducted from my card on 15th November. I made numerous calls from November 8th till yesterday to India but got a shock of my life when T-Mobile Service Provider sent me a hefty bill for all those calls. They told all those calls were made using their Network Towers. I emailed Rebtel Immediately since deliberately there is no customer care number given to call. Another shock I got when a customer care Representative told me that my free trial was expired on same day of activation i.e November 8th and it is reactivated on Nov 15 so now you can make calls. I told about my whole experience and the way he replied was very insensitive and unprofessional. If such is the start experience how can I trust you guys further if me or any of my known person want to use your services?

It is cheaper than most  phone card schemes, and reduces the number of digits one must dial from 30 to 10. However, the sound quality is not always as good as it should be, and calls are often just dropped for no apparent reason, followed by redialing that does not reconnect the call. T reconnect, I must hang up and redial again. All the Rebtel calls I have made have been to a cellphone in the Dominican Republic.

Be Careful while you do the subscription... their website is dodgy, you might have unsubscribed the deal but you will be charged money. 
Secondly, they have a useless subscription called 'World Credits' which charges you more than the prevalent deals for specific countries. 
When you opt for recharge over phone, you will not be subscribed to your preferred country deal rather be parked on World Credit. You will keep talking on that useless world credit subscription which will get as it is outside the deal.

_____________
I (used to) buy between 2400 - 3000 minutes per month from Rebtel. So to say that I'm a loyal customer is an understatement. I typically buy the MaxSaver deals. 

This month Rebtel randomly locked my account. I contacted them right away and they did not respond for 3 days. The MaxSaver deals only last for 14 days. Hence I was unable to use my minutes for those 3 days (roughly 22% of the time given). I have ALWAYS exhausted the minutes in my MaxSaver deals. So this month I lost 285 minutes because they shut off my account. Rebtel refused to extend the deal but instead gave me 20 minutes as ""compensation"" for my inconvenience. I have an international startup and it was disrupted because of Rebtel. AND their solution: 20 minutes. 

I contacted customer service and their response was: 
_____________
Thanks for contacting us!

i totally understand your request but as stated before its not possible for me to extend the period of your deal since the deal no longer shows on your account.

Every deal that expire, disappear totally from the users account.

Best Regards,

Rebtel SHUT DOWN MY ACCOUNT for no reason so I wasn't able to use my minutes and then refused to either extend the deal for the 3 days they made the mistake, nor would they give me my minutes back. I have given that company thousands and this is the response that I receive?

- Skype rates to mobiles in Ecuador are just too expensive. Rebtel offers a real price advantage there.
- Skype's (lack of) customer service is unfamous among the skype community, even as a pay-customer

I was unable to call to any new numbers to India even if I have ""India - Unlimited"" subscription . Tried adding one more subscription and paid $10 but still unable to call.

Now I have TWO ""India - Unlimited"" subscriptions. One Expires on 02/13/2016 and another Expires on 03/14/2016.

Still I am unable to call any new numbers. Like +91 xxxxx-xxxxx

Getting below message: Exceeded number of unique numbers can be called per month.

Please answer:
Let me know when I will be allowed to call new numbers?

How many number we can call even your plan says its ""India - Unlimited"" subscription. Its not really ""unlimited""

Why you call as unlimited if there are restrictions.


There is no phone or chat support. If send email if you are lucky you get some response (not solution) in 4-5 days. The response by customer support person Gustavo ridiculous . Looks like he doesn't know to read English emails. Other reply also doesn't give solution for your problem.

As you don't have phone support and need to wait for 24-28 hours for email response its really ridiculous not allowing to call even after full payment.  

If you have limitation in the subscription why you say it as ""unlimited"" India call ? You don't ashamed to call limited call service as Unlimited. Cheating just because marketing purpose and make money in wrong way.

May be all your unlimited plans are restricted to some level.
After re-branding and new app and website your service become so poor.

I would like to aware all of you about this app. Rebtel deducting money twice a month and they'll use ur credit card info without ur consent and when u gonna look into credit card history, it will be shocking that you hav charged for 14-14 US$ twice a month and they will not gonna give gou refund and they don't even have customer service representatives and contact, where you can call to resolve this issue. 
And they are not apologetic at all for this kind of scam. And if you go and check their website, whoever used this app once, became victim of overcharging. 
Moreover, they're being racist. This is what I personally noticed. As, they are ruling this app from US, bcoz they are charging us in U.s. $. 
If they see, you are either Indian, Pakistani (which one can easily recognize from our name), they'll never ever offer you refund for those fake payments and overpayments. Please be careful and if you still wanna use this app, keep an eye on ur account. 
If, m the only one, who hav this problem. Then I could b wrong. But there are so many people who have addressed this issue and Rebtel isn't resolving it. 
Worse and poor app. Basically, they are stealing ur money and account privacy. For them, Rebtel is another form of theft.

- Further to my last review, Rebtel continued to drop my calls despite charging me for an unlimited minute. They keep using this call dropping technique so that I use less minutes, it's shameless and stupid company who has no understanding about the customer service.  

Updated review as at 30/06/17:
- Further to my review on 17/06/17, I hereby provide some new updates regarding the service i have been receiving from fraudulent co. Just to make it clear, I have took a subscription for an unlimited calls to Bangladesh for a monthly 9.99 pounds which Rebtel increased to 24.99 because they said I am using too many minutes (well thats why i have an unlimited subscription). Anyhow, I still carried on with the subscription despite their awful call quality and customer service.
However, since 28/06/17, I could no longer make a call to bangladesh and they have blocked a number that I call!  When enquired, after complaining several times, they bombarded me with their robotic message, finally Mark Louie from customer service said,'Hello Mr..Tanks for contacting and patience in reaching us! The number has been flagged due to an abnormal use far above what is determined, as normal use, by our system! Calls to that number will be resumed in 7 days. Thanks for understanding!'
- Now, I pay for an unlimited phone calls, mainly to one person. I pay a premium for this service 24.99/month. It's not Rebtel to determine how many mins I speak when I have an unlimited subscription for a very premium charge!
- I would have stopped using service of this crook but I think these corporate thugs getting away with these malpractices with many other customer. So my mission is to push these criminals out of the telecommunication market!


Updated review as at 17/06/17:
-Further to my earlier review, I intent to provide some further update regarding the awful service Rebtel provide. I will shed lights on the call quality, call drops and feedback/help  I have received from Rebtel when complained about the service. 
-I used to have a subscription for unlimited calls to Bangladesh, however, Rebtel increased the monthly subscription from £9.99 to £20.99 when I provided negative review about the co and its awful service. 
- Despite the increase in monthly charge, I still use Rebtel, however every ten/fifteen minutes my calls are dropped, when I complain, they email me a robotic message which goes on to say ""
Hi MR, 
My name is Sophie and I work with customer satisfaction at Rebtel. I noticed that you just rated your last call with 1 out of 5 stars on its quality. 
Something didn't work for you and I want to understand why. Not only because I want to fix any technical issues straight away, but more importantly because offering you the best call quality is my number 1 priority. 
So, help me understand what went wrong: 
Were you calling from home or on the go?
Does it only happen when you call that specific number?
If this was the first time the problem happened, what was different this time?
I really want to solve the problem so anything you can tell me is a HUGE help and I really appreciate it. 

Thank you for taking the time :) 

/Sophie""
Once you provide the info. nothing else happens! Because its f...g rebtel, they don't care about the customer experience as long as they get the monthly charge!
My intention is to give this co a lesson before I cancel the subscription!

The worst company, the worst possible customer customer service and its very expensive. Please DON'T GIVE A PENNY TO THIS FAKE COMPANY.

Each time I report that I cannot make a call , I get an automated message saying ""please provide details of your call""once I provide the details I get no more reply. 

I have an unlimited account with Rebtel to call Bangladesh but I couldn't make any calls in the last two days. When I kept reporting the issues I no longer get a reply even. 

Rebtel as a company you're disgusting and have disgraceful customer service. We all should boycott you!

You're saying you can't locate my account , my phone number is 00447878075930, I have lodged 20 complaints and one standard copied message and no solution! Because I lodged complaints from mobile there is no ticket number. However I am sure Rebtel can check how many I begged them to sort out my connection, AWFUL COMPANY, YOU SHOULD BE SHAMED FOR YOUR SERVICE !
Updated on 23/05/17:

Don't you notice that some prices in USD are 3 times as much as the same prices when presented in GBP or EUR?
This definitely scares away consumers who pay with $, because your prices are dramatically less competitive in USD.

Also, your call prices to UK mobiles could be WAY more competitive if you renegotiate your terms with your connection provider. Mobile termination rates in the UK have gone down significantly and are now about 1-2 GBP pence per minute. But you charge more than 10 GBP pence per minute to UK mobiles.

Calls are very cheap 0.243 for where I call. That beats any other provider, also no 0844 or 0870 numbers to call, where the connection charges are 14.0p, plus poor quality service.

With this you pay a fixed rate and can call from your mobile or landline, where ever you are. Also you can assign local numbers such as 020, 0121, 0114 etc numbers, so when you call that number the call gets directed to the international number, saving you lots of money.

I don't know why they don't keep their promise of an umlimited plan, but this feels like I'm being scammed. Very unhappy about Rebtel.

UPDATE: I got a very fast and kind reply by Rebtel, but unfortunately I don't know how to reply to their answer. So I'll try this way: if there is indeed a limit to the number of phone numbers you can call in one month, Rebtel cannot call the plan ""unlimited"" anymore. Your customers should know about this limitation upfront and you need to tell them how many numbers they have used and how many they have left. Transparency, please!

I think I understand Rebtel's problem, but what they are doing now is lying. You cannot call a plan ""unlimited"" when it is  clearly not. Also, I don't think that I called more than 30 different numbers, which for me is normal use (not sure though how many calls I made exactly).

Recently they introduced a telephone prompt asking you to recharge.the prompt is convenient you press 1 and voila you think your plan is recharged but that's not what happens.The trick here is recharge goes to world credit and unlimited plan is not recharged,the difference is huge.with old unlimited plan for $10 you can make i think some 1200 minutes but now with world credit you can only make 480 minutes for the same amount.
Now I exchanged some 5 emails with support team which is very bad there is no number to call.they pretend they don't know the issue.clearly deceptive and attitude is not good.

I had to flip through the FAQs, read help articles and then they thought they had their fun so after 15 minutes of struggle the website gave me chat option. I still wasn't losing faith in them. I talked to an agent and he was rude and absurd. I even told him how important it was for me to make a call to India. He was totally helpless and I don't even think how to treat customers. He didn't even what I was talking about! When I thought he is not helping me out, I rated him 1 star and ended the conversation.

1) Why was it necessary to recently increase your call prices so much?  The majority of my calls are to Thailand and you raised the cost/minute by almost 300% !!!  

Why was that necesssary RebTel?  Are you getting a bit greedy?  I suspect that your ISP has not raised your costs at anything like that percentage, if at all....

"","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=27","Good, cheap, uninterrupted network and good service","Hi there,
I had been using the Vonage service from United States to call my people in Asia-India and elsewhere, Australia or Dubai, Malaysia and Singapore though it was little expensive(every month charge will be fixed, 40-50$).
However, I was disconnected from the network and I was looking for a cheap method to call India , from my cell phone itself. I had been seeing Rebtel ads but, I was initially apprehensive to use a new and unknown network and also was concerned about the reliability, money transactions etc. But, once I set up my account with the phone number, I found the ease of using it-U can set up local numbers for the international numbers you want to contact and also, dial in from the app whenever necessary, if u want to call any new no that is not stored.So, this is the first advantage. Secondly, they have quite a wide range of plans-depending on fixed and variable talk times. Also, the cost of using it is much reduced(for me, more than 3 times lesser) than the usual methods. If you use any other carrier /network like AT&T, I see their costs are always lil higher-about 5-10$ more for unlimited calls/mins.
So, this way, these are the 2 main reasons, I would continue to use Rebtel for international calling, after my current 2 months usage.
Also, I had an account registered on an earlier number which is not in service now. I was charged for the 2nd month cycle but, basically it was my mistake not to have deleted the account since, I forgot the pin. Later, one support representative has been kind enough to at least help me with deleting or not charging me for my old account. Only one thing, since, this company works out of Luxembourg, they delay a lil by a day or 2 while responding to ur customer service mails. But, they at least reply and are prompt in doing and trying to solve any issues.
One more point is this service is available in UK, Dubai, Africa and other variety of places. They can may be expand their horizon.
Good job. Happy customer...till now..!!! Congrats..and continue this way..

First, let me talk about their SMS service. It sucks! I'm not sure how the system selects on what phone number to assign an SMS icon, most of the time the icon does not appear next to the contact that was added, and an e-mail to the customer service has to be sent, and their reply which will take days to say ""we have received your e-mail"" and then another days to say, it has been fixed. Which I don't have time to wait for, all these in days?? Even when you sent an SMS, it gets delayed almost 90% of the time, and Rebtel always blames the 3rd world countries or the developing countries Telecommunication service, which I have hard time to believe when I can send an sms to 3 different people leaving in the same city/region and radius, only 1 will get the sms in minutes, while the others gets it in hours or even days later. Are you kidding me Rebtel???
The phone service is acceptable considering, occasionally a network problem which can happen with all VIP phones; however whenever I added minutes almost all the time, I won't see my added minutes or balance for another 10-20 minutes, and that is a time I can't afford to lose, since most calls are made overseas and there are time zone concerns and etc...so timing is very important to me, which I never got from Rebtel till the end. I have had a handful of dropped calls while calling different parts of the world; I was given a credit for some, which is of course after complaining. Due to all my experiences,  I did not feel comfortable leaving my CC information saved there during that 6 month I was using.

I then went back into the local numbers directory to see whose number I could delete to free up space only to find out the numbers have been wrongly allocated. Now Paul's number is showing up under Steve's name and Steve's number is now someone else's. My goodness, you couldn't make up the upside down LOGO. Perfect for the new crap called Rebtel.

I bought the Nigeria big saver plan. Even though I may have credit on the saver plan I cannot make calls.  When I try to make call, the message I get is that I have no more credit. The last time this happened I bought additional credit but Still, I could not make a call.  This is very frustrating. The customer service is horrible, the worst of any company I have ever dealt with.  First of all there is no customer service telephone number where you can speak to an actual person. The only option is to leave a message.  When you get a response, it is to tell you that they will respond within 48 hours.  I should therefore wait until 48 hours to make a telephone call that could very well be an emergency?. I WILL GIVE THEM ZERO STARS.  They do not even deserve one star. How can a telephone company not have a telephone number for their customers to call.  I will never recommend Rebtel to any one. I will never use their service again until there is a customer service that actually works like a good company's.  THIS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ITS WORST.

Re: Response from Rebtel
I am not satisfied with your response. Why don't you have a customer service number that your customer can call for help?. A company that cares for its customer will be more sensitive to their concerns. You only confirmed what I said in my review that as a customer I cannot speak directly to a customer support staff who can help resolve a problem immediately. The only way to reach your customer support staff is through Email and the response can take up to 48 hours.  I still stand by my review.

Everything was hunky dory. They introduced ""Unlimited calling"" worth for 30 days to call India. It worked for a day. After that, I get a message ""Your account balance is too low. Please add more credit.""

day 1) Raised a support ticket
day 2) Support came back asking me to give an example.
day 3) I gave them all the details that rebtel wanted.
day 4) No response
day 5) Asked for a response again.
day 5) Rebtel support responded (within 48 hours). Created a local number for the example I mentioned an day 3. Wait a minute, I gave a example as support asked. Nothing is working. Not the example alone. Icing on the top was, the local number they gave, did not work again. Same message, credit more money. They also told me that as a policy they will respond within 48 hours.
on Day (5), I Responded to rebtel that their ""Local access number"" itself is not working. That is what I meant in day (1) report.
day 6 and 7) No response. Where is their 48 hours policy to respond to customers?
It has been well past 48 hours since i responded to rebtel support.

I think this company rolls out products without testing. If the stuff works for you, good. If it does not, your are by yourself and you are in for a wild ride. Their support is extremely unhelpful. They try to pass the ball without taking accountability. I have easily spent many hours worth of effort fighting with something that should just work. Their support is miserable. 

Please let me know if there are choices that I can do. (a) I could call credit card company to refund the payment. (b) I can create awareness of this company to my friends.

Note: I am ready corroborate the entire incident via email chain.

Sure, rebtel rates are fairly cheap but is it really worth it when both of us cannot make out what the other person is saying? We're constantly asking each other to repeat themselves because it's so muffled. We usually end our conversations more frustrated than anything because it's extremely annoying to have to repeat yourself over and over again. Also, there's a feature on the mobile app for collect SMS. Meaning the other person can text you and it will charge you. At least the SMS go through well, right? Well.. yes and no. I was ecstatic to find out that I can pay for her SMS sent to me because being in the Peace Corps, she's limited financially. I turned on the feature and let her know that she can text me freely because she does not have to pay for it. But did it charge me? Nope. Did it charge her? Yes.

Rebtel has given me the worst emotional blue balls a phone service can possibly give to a person.

Rebtel did NOT offer any credit or free call time as a concession for the poor service and disconnected calls.  Other international phone companies always did SOMETHING to make it up to me in the past.

Service was ok for about a year.  Still not the best prices.  Then,  calls would be disconnected in about 10 seconds when calling a land line in Ukraine.  Mobile phones were ok.

Cathy
Do you have a credit on  your local phone plan?

I have taken a look at your account and I see no apparent reason why you are unable to call.
The first thing we kindly ask you is to make sure that you have enough credit on your phone (not on the Rebtel account); Since you have to pay for the local call to our numbers with your local minutes while the international cost of the call is deducted from your prepaid Rebtel credit.

Why i should pay my local numbers, then i realised, i am completely cheated by them","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

Rebtel has responded asking me to file a third complaint about the same problem -- I've done two so far, one via direct email, and one via this site. I'm not inclined, and shouldn't have to, file a third complaint via Facebook messaging, whatever that is.

"44","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=44","Worst audio quality. Use of illegal international call termination via internet and GSM Boxes","Here is why I don't think Rebtel is using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation exclusively for terminating calls in Ethiopia. 
Two Scenarios1. Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)
    * Call is good quality    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of my USA number2. Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated NOT using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)    * Call is bad quality(might even drop)    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of local Ethiopian Mobile Number as if its a local call
I believe this second scenario happens because call is terminated using internet so bypassing Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation and generating a local call using local Ethiopian Mobile Number to the destination number. Sometimes I even hear the exact unique 'your account is low' message (not the Rebtel message) used by  Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation as if I am calling from Ethiopian Mobile phone with low account.  The people I call in Ethiopia are confused to get a call from local Ethiopian Mobile number but talk to me (from USA).  My point is this second scenario does not happen if all Rebtel calls are terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.
The first thing I check when I place a call using Rebtel is ask the person I call if the number they get a call from is from my USA phone or local phone number. If it is my USA number, then great. If not and the caller Id is the local Ethiopian number, I am redialing again, because its bad quality and no use to continue with that call.
 I am clear that Rebtel uses different provider to route call. That is not the issue. The issue here is, which ever provider you choose should terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.
You have been giving me general answers and not addressing the issue (Scenario 2). Rebtel Calls are being terminated illegally in Ethiopia.

I started with Rebtel last month on a trial period and signed up for their $10/month for unlimited calls to India.

I bought this thing so that I could make non commerical calls to family and friends back in India. Why would you restrict this to a few numbers. Whatever dumb person in your company has made this decision let them know that Indians have wider social group and we are a community oriented group.

You couldn't also have refunded it onto my credit card which is what I used for topping up the credit for Rebtel but it's not in use anymore. To emphasise my point you couldn't have possibly refunded the credit, you're certainly not truthful to your customers. 

I checked my rebtel account today 16th April 17 @ 22.12 and notice the credit I had on there for £21.50 has been cleared to £0.00 and I've never used it because the App  does not work it is useless completely useless. 
Rebtel is an App I can't use and my credit has been cleared and I haven't got any refund back. I feel like I've been robbed. Not happy with this App. 

Rebtel requested I update the App last year and I did. Since then I haven't been able to make a single international call but now Pilar from rebtel is telling me I still have the old app so I've just updated it again and its still no use. I have over £20 credit on the App. I need my money refunded in full so I can make these important calls to my family abroad. I don't want to keep playing the old app game. Just refund me my money.

Prices per min changing so quick and by huge difference on this platform. For example when I topped up by fiver on the day it showed my balance 200 min to one European country mobiles,  After three days showed only 8 min available. Price sky rocketing per min from 2,5c to 35c. Mad increased in price without any notification. I dont understand how this can happen??  This is  a joke or scam or what??? Also on the day i been offerd subscription unlimited calls for 7$per month to one european country. Now I dont see any subscription available particulary for that country at all. What I noticed  this crowd working so tricky and fools the people. They advertising and promoting product/service for one price, but at the end consumer gets absolutely different price. This matter  should be reported to consumer protection authorities this absolutely ilegal to act in the way they does. They should be sued for breaching consumer rights. My advice is  shop around for better service. THANKS","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

My monthly bills were way too much money. Now with Rebtel it is a lot more manageable, what a great rate, not to mention the clarity is like calling next door and this is from my cellphone. Also when i call, the cuban operator does not come on and charge me for a minute. This can happen several times trying to get through. I have a good canadian buddy in cuba now, wait til i tell him this, he really likes to save money. I am really happy i found Rebtel on the internet, i will spread the word.

Now and again I had echo on the line but in general, not too bad. But then, oh my... why, oh why, oh why?!! The new branding with it's poorly designed interface is a total and utter disaster! First time I logged in I couldn't dial any of my local numbers because they weren't ready yet! What? So they change their logo and interface and roll it out although it won't work! Joke. I can't edit numbers, I can't add any numbers, if I delete numbers it won't allow me connect a new one.

I've been in contact with Rebtel via email for the past 3 or 4 days and the issues are still not sorted. I've had brief 'brush-off' replies from Maribel, Zahid, Alexandra and Vilhelm, just stalling and not understanding the issue. Very poor. Like many on here, I also believe that unless they change it back immediately, we'll all be gone.

And Wanda, no I was not given a ticket number as I contacted you via your website and since then via email. The original text (and subsequent title of each email) is: ""Where are my numbers? Why on earth would you roll out a new look which doesn't even work??!!!! All I want is to make calls, not see a new stupid interface!""


Wanda - this is for you to copy and paste in your reply:-
I am sorry you've been having problems [insert issue here]. We are doing all we can to [insert lie here]. You can be assured that we are [make up some crap and type it in here].

About call quality, price - I have absolutely no complaint.  It was a smooth experience, until sometime in January 2016, when all changed.  Rebtel changed their website – for the worst possible experience for the customers.  I couldn’t access my account after successful login, and contacted the customer service on Feb 3rd of 2016. I received email from the support telling me how they can see I have logged in (after I have already mentioned that I could login and unable to access my account).  And then started emails every other day, suggesting me to try other browser, deleting cookies etc. – one email – one suggestion.  It took exactly 14 days for the issue to be fixed by their technical team.  
Now the new saga – can’t edit my local numbers or add any other.  I contacted the customer service again.  After several emails, when I mentioned I only 19 local numbers and I am allowed 20, I get this email that I have 20 – now I have sent them screenshots.  I thought companies strive to get better – never thought will find one that is trying and achieving to get worse by leaps and bounds until Rebtel.  This is a prime example of what a customer service should never be.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

Call rates are will play key role in your APP. before RED app update call rates are little low (That's why i choose Rebtel - for Example per cal 1.25 Cents/Mint to india, but After RED update 2.5C ent/M to India). This not at all acceptable double price.

And i would like bring one more thing. Unlimited Calls to India 10$/Month. You guys no where mentioned about How many phone numbers allowed to dail (I came to know 33 phone numbers only allowed from my Rebtel friend). if it crossed 33 phone numbers i mean 34 phone number automatic voice saying you are exceed call number for this month. in this case if anything urgent call to india? i am gone case.

So i will look for another application depends on your reply.

"4","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=4","Problem solved!","I started Rebtel with the ""try it free for 1 week"" with subscription for Indonesia unlimited - I've made a couple of calls to Indonesia and they were great. On the last day of that 1 week free trial, when I tried to make a call, I got the message saying,""Your account balance is too low..."" so without knowing the app very well I  accidentally put $10 on the world credit. I emailed the ""help"" at Rebtel and I got a reply which was basically saying that they can't refund my world credit and they are basically using whichever credit with the closest valid date (I honestly didn't really understand it, but I let it go). The next day when my 1 week free trial is up, I paid the $10 monthly subscription for Indonesia Unlimited (6/29/2017) and I can also see that my world credit balance has kept going down as I made calls to Indonesia (which I thought it was supposed to be covered by the monthly subscription). Today (7/7/17) with ACTIVE Indonesia unlimited account (renewed in 23 days) and $6.14 in my World Credits - I placed a call to Indonesia and guess what? I got this message again: ""Your account balance is too low..."" Uuumm...can anyone give me a reasonable explanation for this please?! I feel like canceling my account at this time but I would like my money back first. Thank you.

UPDATE:
I emailed Rebtel Support regarding this problem and I got their response within less than 24 hours. We were emailing back and forth regarding this issue. They asked me several questions and I answered them in details. On the same day (less than 24 hours), we figured out what's wrong: I had my iPhone set up with hidden caller ID that way Rebtel couldn't recognized my phone number (which is the account) when I was placing the calls. I did this setting a couple days ago when I was using my cellphone for work and I forgot to change back the setting.
Having said that, problem solved and I think Rebtel Customer Support team were VERY responsive and really on top of it to get to the bottom of the problem I was experiencing.
Not going to cancel my account. Thank you!","star-rating count-4 size-medium clearfix"

After submitting a request for a refund I got a reply telling me that they are doing their best to keep the prices but are forced to increase them due to capacity issues and to be able to sustain the same level of quality. 

This the worst case of cheating the customer as the money is taken upfront and the terms are changed after. Is done so sneakily - without notifying the customer as well. 

The amount I have given these people is not much, but I feel disgusted by such enterprises which feel can do this and hide behind their T&Cs (which I am sure they have for this type of situation).

When I contacted them to learn how that happened, they promised me not to happen again that never fixed. our action were cut off their service.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

Second - Cannot pay for your account anymore if you used ""multiple"" cards for payments! Can you believe this? So, every time we will need to remember the card that was used for last payment!!

Third - They accuse me of creating ""Multiple Accounts"" since I recharged mine and husband's Rebtel account with my credit card!
Duh, don't we have single account for one phone number? How does it matter if my card is used to pay for my family!!
Now, I cannot buy any plans unless I have a PayPal account!

This service is definitely a headache and more useless since they have too many problems, but no customer support number to talk to solve those! Just email them and no guarantee that anyone will reply..","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

"52","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=52","Over good but some improvements required","Call quality is good once connected , but i have few bad experiences
Cons:
- you get ring tone even if the other side phone is not available or engaged. usually you should get beep sound so you know the other side phone is not available, you don't try again.
- if your balance is around 200 mins it won't allow two registered phones to make calls at the same time. It says "" there is another call going on..."" . I understand this as enforced to make sure running call has enough mins to finish. but 200+ is too high threshold it should be reduced to 30 mins or so.

Pros:
Good thing is it works on wifi, so you don't have to worry about poor signal or phone minutes.

Few days ago I attempted to log in and make some international calls and was surprised on not just the look and feel of the new website but also the functionality. 
I don't know if you guys have a Quality Assurance department or what they do there but the old website was professional, easy to use and navigate, the new one is a joke.!!!! From the look I could tell this would be a disaster. I couldn't log in easily, the password was overlapping with the text in the password field, I couldn't view my contacts as they are still working on the contacts directory (joke), I could still make calls though as I had a balance, but certainly once I exhaust the funds, I don't have I'll still want to top up unless the mess is sorted out.

I have been a customer with Rebtel for 6 years and never had cause to worry till April, 23rd 2010. They took money from my account (supposedly my monthly subscription charge) without an email or adding minutes to my account. I had a monthly subscription and it was all going well. I would get an email immediately it's gone through and also have the minutes loaded into my Rebtel account.
My bank on the other hand has never alerted me of a fraud purchase but for this purchase they did. First thing I did before confirming it was a fraud was to check my inbox for an email and also my Rebtel account for the minutes purchased but to my bewilderment, there was no email sent, neither was there $15 worth minutes added to my account so I responded a ""no"" to my bank. It was a type yes or no answer if you recognize that purchase and an email or the purchased minutes in question, I didn't recognize that purchase.
Rebtel went ahead to restrict my access to my account. I have not been able to use the $9 worth of minutes I already had in my account for almost two weeks.
They clearly showed great detest stating that I should have notified them first before notifying my bank. I went to great lengths explaining to them that 
- this had never happened, 
- I didn't go to my bank, they reached out to me 
- I waited for hours to receive their email to confirm the payment,
- I also asked them to check their records and see that I never got an email confirmation of my payment as is always the case.
- I also said my minutes weren't added. 
They sent me emails insisting it was there. I have sent over 6 emails to them explaining but they have told me they will not give me access to my account unless I call my bank and admit the charge, get them to provide a written letter stating it was not a fraud and sent the letter to me. 
My entire friends and family who have also been in Rebtel for over 7 years are shocked.
I have never been backmailed in my life and to think that I would betray my person considering also the services my bank provides me in protecting my account is just beyond me.
Rebtel is basically punishing me for refusing to be blackmailed. 
After over 6 years of being on this service why would I jump up to create a dispute if they were no grounds? It was a clear fraud and I feel bad I have recommended them to all my family and friends in US and the UK? And for $15? I guess a smart way is to make me loose my $9 as well.

Well.. I didn't read the terms in detail but I guess I will never ever use Rebtel again.  I don't think this is a good practice. Even I didn't use for a year, still I put the money into your company.  Lucky I found out there are many phone apps now that enable you to talk on the phone overseas like ""Line"" is good to use it as phone talking. I love WeChat for text messaging, Line's phone quality is better but you can try both. The video & talk not very smooth I guess depends on both connection.

Unlike its competitors, Rebtel line is crystal clear - even better than BT line.

I did so - and she claimed that They will consider a refund ""on my own cost"" - and immediately I asked how much will that ""cost"" be - and as soon as the question was posted, in the course of the live chat, the rep evaporated, and  totally ignored  the question, now over 24 hours have passed and I have posted ""reminders"" to no avail...

They call THAT ""CUSTOMER SERVICE""?

For such a level of service. I wonder if they deserve any customers at all...
A reminder: when I signed up for Rebtel It was for a specific basket of services, for which I paid in advance.
The basket ""shrunk"" - in other words Rebtel took the money and did NOT deliver on the services, and for a few years refuse to refund their ill-gotten-gains, and even the rep that contacted me did not have the honesty to answer a simple question!

My advice: Use alternate app - and keep away from ""Rebtel""!","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

Hi Shawn,

Thank you for contacting us!

I can see from your account that the minutes of your deal have expired on 2014-02-08 and that is your regular credit that was used for your calls then.

Our deals are limited in time (depending on the deal selected) meaning that all unused minutes are automatically removed after the expiry date. We are therefore not able to refund or transfer them.

The information about this limitation is displayed when you click on the selected deal.

Sorry for any confusion and thanks for your understanding!

Best Regards,

Walid

I have also faced the same issue of terminating the account saying abnormal behaviour and we are getting default answer when we contact them like saying minutes usage, unique customers and multiple device. If you find such a behavior, Rebtel should cancel the subscription by asking the evidence not by terminating the account.. Many people bought the subscription in recent days and got terminated, how come there will be abnormal usage. And Rebtel is advertising like true unlimited, why so if not able to provide maximum usage.. Also many people had the credits in their account that also gone.. When we contact them , no proper answer for 2-3 days and finally giving default answer.. If you want to provide default answer then why are u waiting to reply after 2 days, u might have sent some auto reply with default message.. Full of disappointments.. Kindly do something to solve all of our problem by modifying the terms and conditions with limited usage, not saying unlimited..

But what i found is , i could not  able to make call more than 8 TO 10 unique numbers .That means ! the numbers you are accesing are limited . if you try accessing more than this a voice message will inform you that ¨you have crossed the limitation of unique numbers¨ . so it is clear that you cannot call more random numbers in an unlimited scheme but you can call unlimited to your limited numbers means numbers you used to talk frequently. And Rebtel did not mention this properly  when they advertising as ¨Hijacking real phone lines to liberate international calling¨ or ¨cheap as hell ¨ in their website .And their is no even any official customer contact or support for Rebtel. If you had to face any Real time  issues . You need to mail them about it  . i wonder why ? but may rebtel  still using 1 gen computers .

We have 2 kids, our son who is 8 years old and elder daughter who is 12 years old. Both the kids are very responsible and manage their activities on their own. We have tried several cheap international calling facilities, but none of them had good voice clarity, and surprisingly none of them turned out to be cheap as promised.

Our neighbours recommended Rebtel. They had a lot to say about Rebtel and its cheap international calling plans. They were quite convincing and we too tried Rebtel. As a starter we got 5 minutes of free calling and since it was Easter week the call rates were further low than their normal rates. Our kids love this service and believe me the voice clarity is very good. 

Not to forget, Rebtel to Rebtel calling is free, so most of the times we are actually speaking free, unless we have to call some other number. Recently I got an e-newsletter from Rebtel, they serve more than 51 countries and every week they have some special offer.

Its good to know how technology can help you save money. Thank you Rebtel.

Defiantly need to improve the Fake Dial tone or ring tone. If I make a call it is keep ringing with a fake ring tone, until other side pick up the phone. I also use other phone service where I get real ring tone. with that I know how many time it was ring, If the phone is off, or out of network, or busy. Also if the receiver set a ring tone for me I can hear that too. But with Rebtel you are blind - until the other side pick up the phone and talk to you.
Another thing is that, If you have a deal plan Rebtel does not tell you how many minutes do you have? or how many minutes left while you are calling.

Most of my friends use Rebtel. People like me use Rebel to talk to their loved ones, who lived in overseas. Once they are here they stop the service because Rebtel becomes expensive on a monthly basis when you use with home phone or even with your cell phone for occasional use.","star-rating count-3 size-medium clearfix"

Unfortunately this company is a big scam, I am usually charged for the minutes that I didn't talk, for example today I made a phone call and it was ringing for 5 minutes then got disconnected, I got charged 6 minutes for that, if you call someone and hang up before it even rings you should expect at least 2 minutes reduced from your total minutes. The other major problem with this scam company is, there is no way to talk to anyone to resolve any problem, I try to send messages regarding these issues, all I get is a garbage robot replying to me saying sorry! I am stupid enough to stay with this company for that long, this is my last transaction with them, I want other users to be aware of this company and stay away.
UPDATE: Stupid reptel you have a web commando with name Maja, what you don't have is A real customer service that's why no humans should buy your garbage product! Maja (The Reblet Commando/Special Mouthpiece) check this phone number and see if you haven't charged me 1000 plus minutes in the past 2 months alone, also check and tell me if I haven't spent hundreds in just two months not to mention the whole 4 + years. the number you should look at for is 3373530627.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

I got an email from Rebtel yesterday, congratulating the Islamic Eid after Ramadan!
I was really shocked to see that Rebtel has categorized me as a Muslim and is spying on my contacts! This is a very big marketing mistake for them! Rebtel is a telecom. company, and should not in any way involves the religious belief of customers in their marketing strategy. Rebtel SHOULD NOT spy on my contact lists! I am looking to replace Rebtel with something else due to these facts:
- Bridge of my privacy and categorizing me as a 6-cylinder Muslim while I have no religious affiliation.
- The quality is very very BAD for the first time connections. You have to re-call to get a better quality. In this way, they can charge more minutes! 
- I am not sure if they sell consumers data to NSA etc etc! What if I go under the surveillance of NSA etc etc because you Rebtel guys put me in practicing Muslim lists. 
If Rebtel does not provide any satisfactory explanation for me, I will definitely go after them both legally and on the net. I warn everyone about these serious issues.


------
This is my response to Rebtel team's response:
------------------ 
Dear Rebtel Team,

Religion is a very sensitive issue! PLEASE DO NOT use it for marketing purposes! 

You should be aware that in those countries, there are a large group of minorities who are suffering from religious related discrimination and violations!

Let me give you an example to make the case clear if it is hard for you to understand my point: 

- Your job is to connect people in the best way! Not to congratulate the birth day of Muhammed, Moses or Jesus, based on the stereotypes! What about sending an email to Neo-Nazis congratulating Hitler's birthday, and having some Holocaust survivors in the that mailing list, too! Are you guys sending a Merry Christmas message to Christian minorities in these Islamic countries. Of course not!

In short, you guys should not be identifying your diverse body of customers based on their religions!!! That is like labeling people! In all of those countries you named there are tens of non-Islamic religions. 

I might have called some of those countries that you named but this is my business and NOT YOUR business to track my calling list and put me in your ""Muslim Box""! What if I call India another day: 

Am I a Hindu or Buddhist or Muslim or Christian or ...?!!! That is ridiculous! 

This is exactly what NSA programs are doing! Checking who is calling whom and how long and then label them! And they will be very pleased to know that you guys have reduced their work load with your religion boxes with the names of costumers!! 

Being at any points of the world, does not give you any immunity from NSA or other agencies! Are suggesting you guys have a better security than Google and Yahoo and Apple ;) 

By the way, are 100% of people in Sweden Christian and love Jesus and go to Church!? Of course not! So, that is non-sense to get religious messages involved in the business, specially cherry-picking for Muslims.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

I sent my post this morning because I was not happy with the level of service and for the fact that I had sent them 2 emails but had not gotten a reply.

But I can honestly say Rebtel have redeemed themselves by replying to my email and crediting my account so I want to use this forum to say thank you to Rebtel and to encourage you guys to keep up the good work and to always put your customers first.

I made the call using their app which clearly displayed the contact number and the time I had left.

Before it is ringing at the other party, why you issue to ring sound to the caller.

You say unlimited calling in subscriptions, but there is some limit with in to call only few numbers unlimited. You say it is not for commercial purpose. Even for home use many ppl call many friends like me, why the hell then you say unlimited calling.

To be fair for the last three years I have been using google voice and Cuballama both of which have dropped calls, and sometimes it's almost impossible to hear eachother - as seems to be the case for most Cuban communications. I had high hopes having read the reviews on using Rebtel to call Cuba and getting crystal clear connections. So far: most of the time when I call it doesn't even ring on his end, and it eventually (1.5 min or more of ringing) it takes me to a message from Verizon (my carrier) saying the call couldn't be completed. Once in a while it connects perfectly and I can hear him very well - the best so far. He can not hear me as well, one time he got clear reception of my voice. My problem is the few times we have successfully connected, a few minutes into the conversation it drops the call and then I cannot get it to connect to him again no matter how many times I try to reconnect. It's so frustrating. I usually cannot get it to ring through to him again until the next day - and then again only once and only for about 10 minutes before it drops the call and won't reconnect.

Before last week I always had a good experience about their quality of service, both technical service and customer service. I have recommended rebtel to my family members and friends in the past.

Recently I had a bad experience.

The support was poor for the first time. I recently changed my phone number. Therefore, I requested to transfer my money from old number to new number. There was  partial money from reference bonus. Ms.  Laura was customer agent from Rebtel end. She said that bonus credit is not transferable. It was absolutely fine if that is the Rebtel policy. I did not know Rebtel policy. So, I made my request and as a customer agent her job was to explain me nicely what can be done or cannot be done based on Rebtel Policy. 

However, in stead of nicely explaining me, she started to blame me that I am abusing and misusing. The terms ""abuse"" and ""misuse"" were very insulting and objectionable, especially when it was baseless and with an old customer.  It was very unprofessional behavior of Ms. Laura from Rebtel end. Then she threatened me to block my account in future.  Her whole message was rude, non-sense and unprofessional. 

I expressed my dissatisfaction about her rude language in response email. She never asked apology for this rude behavior.

In the past I had opportunity to communicate with Ms. Cintia and Ms. Alexandra,who are very nice and professional but Ms. Laura was unlike them from Rebtel. 

It was a bad experience.   It gave me the feelings that Rebtel does not care their customers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank You so much for the reply. I feel much better to see your reply. I am not sure about the facebook page. So, i am replying here. The case number was Request #709001. Just to clarify once again, I have no complain about not transferring the bonus credit. I did not know Rebtel's policy about bonus credit. 

 I HAVE complain because she behaved rude with me by using terms ""abuse"", ""misuse"" and by saying ""she would block my account in future.""  That was an unacceptable treatment to a customer of more than 3 years old and who regularly use Rebtel by paying money every month.  The complain is about her behavior.

Thank You once again.... :)","star-rating count-3 size-medium clearfix"

My name is Neil Waters.

I made a payment on my phone today (06/05/2017) and added the subscription to call India unlimited for $10 (US) and every time i try to make a call using the phone number it keeps on saying please enter the number and then my pin and beeps 4 times and call gets disconnected. 

On the app, under ""CHOOSE YOUR CONNECTION"", when i remove the PHONE LINES option, the call gets connected using WIFI or CELLULAR DATA, and the call reception is extremely bad and poor in quality........and the call drops frequently.

I used to be able to call INDIA directly using the PHONE LINES connection on my cell phone and the call quality was good.....I did not have to use WIFI or CELLULAR DATA before.......

What you guys can do is, refund me the $10 (US) and will re-do the subscription again online, maybe then the problem will be solved.

I mailed you guys several time but you guys still haven't replied. 

Can you guys please contact me by call 16474570045

There are so many issues, including variable call quality, dropping calls but the biggest issue is  auto connections via a credit card, even when you cancel the card. I spent almost £150  , when I would normally spend about £40 just because they changed the system so that even though you have credits they take money via the phone when you dial, even if you cancel auto top up. The  staff 'investigate' but came back with woolly explainations that don't explain how the system has recently changed. Do not ever use your credit card wth these bandits, as even if you cancel they still retain your details and will charge you for connecting or making a call without any sensible reasoning. I will never trust them again and will be reporting them to trading standards.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

In this time and age, who would remember any phone numbers anyways? 

One feature I regret that Rebtel hasn't offered to me but my German colleague enjoys is that she can generate a domestic phone number for her mom in Germany to call her back on her. I hope this feature can soon be offered to other parts of the world. Thanks.","star-rating count-4 size-medium clearfix"

Great Company.","star-rating count-5 size-medium clearfix"
"36","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=36","From fantastic to worse to worst","In my opinion, Rebtel is an excellent example, how a great idea and innovation becomes a true disaster. I was probably one of the first international users of Rebtel and registered my numbers in 3 different countries. I found it fantastic and recommended it to many of my friends. 

As a result I received several credits and enjoyed sort of free calling for a while - until, suddenly, the credits got an expiration date! It's like taking an award away, but also taking my motivation away to recommend it to more friends. 

And while I don't really care, when Rebtel changes it's lovable logo to an aggressive red and upside down logo for no reason, I do care, when one of the most practical services - to use SMS - is taken away. This is not only absolutely ridiculous, but also unacceptable to change the rules for a service, that people might have signed up for, just to use the option of sending SMS, because it is (besides email) the best way to communicate with people in very different time zones.

Some more bad news: When I tried to change some of my current ""local numbers"", they were DELETED, which also meant in some cases, that I lost these numbers completely. But when I tried to add those again, that I still had in my contacts with corrected info, the system tells me, that I ran out of local numbers and cannot add any additional ones.

And don't you wonder, why there is not even a link on their webpages to contact any customer service? In the beginnings of Rebtel I was even in touch with one of their founders, Jonas Lindroth, now everybody is hiding in anonymity. I guess, their is a reason for that ...

Maybe someone answers at least here to the following question: As I will not use Rebtel anymore, as soon as I cannot send SMS, how do I get my money back, that is currently on my 3 accounts (US, Europe, SouthEast-Asia)?

P.S. I totally agree with all the other reviewers here, specifically with Raul Perez. The ""new"" Rebtel is a total disaster.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

Some phone services have hi-fi methods/plans which may be tough to implement by the common man.

But Rebtel is simple, cheap and seems to be way better than conventional calling methods. Here the phone bell rings immediately as you dial the number, unlike other phone services which I have tried in this past. Though they charge a minimal price, yet the Call quality has been excellent so far.

After I got accustomed to this service and was satisfied about the same, I encouraged my loved ones to register with Rebtel. My family in abroad has been using this since a year and even my relatives and friends who are dispersed across the globe. All of them are thankful to me for recommending Rebtel.

The company offers you very reasonable international calls rates to various locations by assigning specific local phone numbers to your calls recipients in their countries. 

Rebtel also offers you the benefit of several freebies. You can call your friend and ask him to hang up for some time, and call you back while you stay on the line. You'll be connected and you get the ‘free’ call advantage of the international part. It may sound weird but trust me it works.

Also, you get a trial 5-minutes phone call to any number and not to forget all calls between Rebtel members are free. However, to enjoy this freebie, your friend may not necessary be a Rebtel subscriber at all but both of you must be living in one of the 51 Rebtel countries.","star-rating count-5 size-medium clearfix"

I recently found out about rebtel and very quickly downloaded it  as an alternative to quite expansive italian rates for abroad calls. I needed sth cheap to stay in touch with my friends and family in Poland. However I found out the hard way that rebtel  fees and rates are not as clear as company want us to believe in. For example when you top up credit they charge extra tax to it. So for example a 20€ credit actually costs you 23€. But it's not all. According to the rebtel website a single minute to polish mobile phone should cost me 0,119€ but after a brief chat with my sister ( around 4 min) 1,5€ disappeared from my account. Connection itself isn't great either. So overall not sure if  Rebtel is such a great deal after all.

"116","https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.rebtel.com?page=116","Rebtel, a well-programmed service","As a manufacturer in New York, I make several calls to Europe since my business runs there too.
I use my mobile phone so much that I just can’t have the count of it but that hardly matters since
Rebtel gives me an affordable service.

The functionality of Rebtel is really simple. My contact list is programmed into my phone and
each one has a unique phone number, and it’s great to ask the other person to call. This service
isn’t expensive and the rates are way better than calling cards. The quality of each call brings a
smile to me.

Initially Rebtel sounded a little strange to request the other party to call back but later on it
became a routine. It’s so cool! I make a call to someone and he says shall I call you back? I
would suggest, if it’s going to be short calls then don’t ask for a call back, since the rates are way
affordable.

Let me not forget to mention about quality, since I am frequent international caller I tried several
calling card which used to charge me a heavy price. Not only that, even the quality of the each
call was way bad and the wait time for the ring was too long. The service would cause pain
rather than comfort. I used to get cut off so often that would disturb my business conversation.

With Rebtel the call quality is crystal clear and it starts ringing right away.

So if you want to save your money and make life easy, Go for Rebtel!

Good: Ease to execute and great call quality

Bad: None","star-rating count-5 size-medium clearfix"

I purchased a subscription with Rebtel last month June for less than £10. I followed the instructions that was given to me. I made two phone calls to Portugal and I was charged by 02 just over £28 for two calls around 22 minutes. I am very glad that I didnt use it more that otherwise I would be charged a fortune. I sent a few e-mails to Rebtel but didnt get any answers. I am afraid I will be looking into it and make a complaint.
I am very unhappy with the service.","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!!!

I'm absolutely furious following yet another failed call overseas!!

Following each telephone connection overseas the call lasts literally less than a minute before I am advised that I am ""low on credit"" and following the recording the call cuts out! I have asked the non-existent customer service department to kindly advise me what is going on? 

I have paid for and unlimited monthly service to Poland...therefore this should NOT be occurring!! 

I requested a response from RebTel as I needed to know what is going on or what I need to do to fix the problem! 

I need to call overseas as a matter of urgency  as I have a family emergency yet I can't contact my family because of the useless RebTel service!! 

Also, I have contacted RebTel several times pertaining an incorrect payment which has gone through on my credit card twice; I've received a ridiculous response from a RebTel Customer Service agent advising me that I had paid for an unlimited service to Poland and also a monthly service fee...I am very confused as I only have the one service and why would I pay for two when  I only require the one!! I have asked RebTel to clarify this matter for me and also either refund the second payment or advise me of an alternative. 

I've advised RebTel that if I don't get a response pertaining the payments I will be forced to contact my bank/credit provider and advise them to cancel the relevant payments!!

I assured RebTel of my continued attention with relation to these matters but still have had NO RESPONSE!!!

By the comments I have read here on TrustPilot it appears as though RebTel's reputation leaves a lot to be desired!!!

It saddens me greatly to say this but  if you value your time and money then avoid this company at all costs! Sadly I would never recommend RebTel to anyone!! Very disappointing!!!","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"

I used this service to call a relative whose 70 in Ireland - she decided to get rid of her landline and I now call on here Irish standard Mobile number which begins with 08 I could see my credits dropping drastically for the past few months so decided to add ""REBTEL Subscription to call Irish number Landlines and Mobiles free all month"" What a shambles. They have taken nearly £5 in credit as well as charge me £5 for a subscription that doesn't cover ""Premium numbers"" It's an Irish Mobile that your so called Tech department cant differentiate . Terrible service that I've taken to Trading Standards and will be advertising such bad service to friends and family too to avoid from these amateurs - VERY DISSAPOINTING REBTEL consider me an EX Customer along with all my family

JUST SO YOU KNOW REBTEL THE NUMBER CALLED IS TESCO MOBILE IRELAND - HARDLY PREMIUM RATE. I'VE REPORTED YOU TO TRADING STANDARDS
================update 25th July 20:30pm==================
It's not a special number - it's TESCO MOBILE in Ireland a mobile network that should be included in your ""unlimited"" package but because your engineers have not updated the mobile service you will not admit your responsibility - you have offered me £30 in rebtel credit even though you have charged me more than 4x the per minute rate for 6 months making over £50 I have reported you to UK trading standards for false advertising and I am waiting a response from you","star-rating count-1 size-medium clearfix"
